            <h2>Prediction of Lung Cancer Using Convolutional Neural Network</h2>
            <p>The CNN models classify the identified regions as either cancerous or non-cancerous. Advanced models can even differentiate between various types of lung cancer, such as Adenocarcinoma, Large Cell Carcinoma, and Squamous Cell Carcinoma. The final stage of the process involves evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Recent studies have demonstrated that CNNs can achieve high accuracy rates in detecting lung cancer from CT images, which holds great promise for early diagnosis and improved treatment outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Profit Analysis on Global Superstores using DA with Power BI</h2>
            <p>Profit analysis on global superstores using Data Analytics (DA) with Power BI involves leveraging Power BI's powerful data visualization and business intelligence tools to gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and profitability across different regions. By collecting and processing sales transaction data, businesses can create dynamic and interactive dashboards that highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) such as order quantity, sales, profit, and customer demographics. These dashboards enable stakeholders to drill down into high-profit and low-profit products, analyze sales trends, and make data-driven decisions to optimize business strategies and improve overall performance.</p>
